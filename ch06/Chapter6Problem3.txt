Adding this property to sprite data will allow for "stacking" sprites on top of each other. This can be useful for allowing moving sprites to "pass over" each other without colliding, or for using one sprite to cover another. Covering one sprite with another would be useful for creating breakable containers such as crates or barrels that could be broken by the player to receive the item underneath. It could also be used to change the appearance of an object, though it would only work a single time. For things that can be broken or only need to change a single time, this can work better than creating entirely new states.

The code that would need to be modified is the sprite.js file. The object would need a new property called zIndex and the prototype's draw method would need to include a function that checks if sprites are overlapping and then draws the sprite with the higher zIndex on top.
