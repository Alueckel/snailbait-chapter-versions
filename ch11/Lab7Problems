Chapter 11 Problem 3:
Changing the size of the bounding boxes for collision means that there are larger or smallers areas that will trigger the collisions. Larger boxes mean the runner doesn't have to get as close to the object in order to collide with it. Smaller boxes mean that the runner must get closer to the object to collide with it. It is important to have the boxes be about the same size as the sprite so that the collision is triggered when the player expects it to - large boxes will make the collision happen even when the runner is far away from the object, and small boxes will make it harder to trigger the collision. having strangely sized boxes can lead to player frustration and generally making the game feel "bad" to play.
